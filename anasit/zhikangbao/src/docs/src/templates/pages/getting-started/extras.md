# Material Avatars

In the material-avatars folder you will find our set of material avatars, over 1400 material style avatars.

The images are divided into 2 folders men and women each containing subfolders for each face type.

Or if you have the skills you can always grab the MaterialAvatars.ai file and edit it yourself in Adobe Illustrator.

# Material Font

In the material-font folder you will find our set of material font characters.

We have proivded a full alphabet and number set of images.

Or if you prefer you can always open the material-font.ai in Adobe Illustrator and modify the font as you like.

# PSD files

In the PSD folder you will find the PSD design file for the {{theme.name}} template.

# Triangular API

To make sure that {{theme.name}} is API ready we created a test API in PHP to call.

This is what provides the dummy data that is used on the Email and Example pages.

We have included it here in case anyone wants a start on creating their own API.
