*** Previous Reviewers comments ***

1. MENU - http://envato.d.pr/18yaO/vUddFRX5 - While its fine to have this common structure, the menu could do with some work and it could be helped with a better font selection and/or placement.

2. REV SLIDER - http://envato.d.pr/14Dvr/54aPrasi - The caption could be improved as it doesn’t draw attention. In addition, the typography and visual hierarchy can be improved. You can read more about visual hierarchy here:  http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-visual-hierarchy-in-web-design--webdesign-84

3. SERVICES SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/E0PR/4XuKhfUl - We can see that you’ve change the icons and font here. Again, its fine to have a common structure/layout like this which is from the builder. However, the visual flow and personality need to be stronger. Currently, it looks plain and not inviting as it could be.

4. CTA SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1lwPF/1AUDxNW0 - The action button is important for a website, so deserves greater emphasis, and attention to it’s design. The same goes for the tagline.

5. OUR WORK SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1dmv4/YwftTyrJ - Its fine to have the common strucutre like this (almost all other themes have one), but the title of this section and the description need to draw attention. The visual flow can be improved.

6. STAFF SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1g6I8/3lpax1Ci - This is a good use of font and great example for better visual flow/identity/personality! :-)

7. COUNTERS SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1jVkn/510yvKNz - This section looks plain. The information needs better presentation. Please consider use of a better font combination in order to improve its presence.

8. TESTIMONIALS SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1fvmN/2T0RIpyU - It’s fine to use this common layout/structure from the builder. However, currently it doesn’t provide a strong concept or identity. The styling looks minimum and bootstrap-like. It looks crowded with the text and there isn’t enough detail in these elements to establish a distinctive and strong visual flow.

9. OUR PARTNERS SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1c7rx/4gXQYYFK - While this is a good concept, it doesn’t work well with other elements on this page or, other elements you have in the builder.

10. RECENT POSTS SECTION - http://envato.d.pr/1juVg/3rIh6naW - The design of this section looks unfinished. The visual flow can be improved with better visual hierarchy or types. Please refer to the article mentioned above. As for the design, the three boxes look repetitive and plain.

11. BLOG LIST PAGE - http://envato.d.pr/16WQE/2EnT8QP8 - The blog page is a core feature and it also sets the tone of a theme. The provided blog page is plain and needs more of  an identity. The spacing is inconsistent and the visual hierarchy needs improvement. This also applies to the widgets. Its fine to use absolute minimal design here, but the details matter especially with such design. Every pixel counts, the image size ratio, the title font size, weight, line-height, the spacing between paragraphs, medias, sidebars and the post meta placements/design.

12. SINGLE POST - http://envato.d.pr/1g7zA/44pp5Qkm - needs better spacing, the layout is generic and plain, it’s over-crowded and it’s like a bootstrap layout with no concept

13. BLOCK QUOTE - http://envato.d.pr/134MS/48JwFU1F - typography should be better

14. COMMENT FORM - http://envato.d.pr/TaQI/5q7AcgxR - dated look and bootstrap-like
